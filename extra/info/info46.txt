Handler

Handlers are people who assist fursuiters while they are in their costumes.

While in their costumes, fursuiters can find it hard to walk, see, or talk in some cases. 

This is why handlers exist! Handlers are people who help out fursuiters by directing them, communicating with people, and generally making sure the fursuiter themselves are comfortable and safe. They are also commonly responsible for managing the fursuiterâ€™s belongings.
