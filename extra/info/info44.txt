Fursuit

A fursuit is a type of animal character costume sometimes worn by people in the furry fandom. 

The term fursuit usually refers to a costume that covers the entire body but it can also refer to “partials”, costumes that only consist of a head, hands and/or feet. Some people also consider mascot costumes to be kinds of fursuits.

A person who wears a fursuit is referred to as a fursuiter. Fursuiting refers to the act of a fursuiter role-playing as their character. Sometimes this can be as simple as just walking around as their character, but it can also include greeting and interacting with other people, taking poses, and even dancing. 

Many fursuiters don’t talk while wearing their costumes because of a variety of reasons:

—Talking in human languages might break the character they’ve created.
—They might think their voice sounds wrong for the character or be strange coming through the head.
—Some fursuiters might want to keep their identity and gender secret. 
—Some fursuits have a fixed mouth, making it seem awkward when they talk.
