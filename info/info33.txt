The Jade Emperor （{font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}玉皇大帝{/font}, Yuhuang Da Di）

In Chinese culture, the Jade Emperor is one of the representations of the first god, and the god of the highest position in Taoist theology. He is also known as Tian Gong, which literally means "The Heavenly Lord".

Instead of crafting statues, worshippers of The Jade Emperor build "Incensory of Heavenly Lords". This is because people believe that crafting statues with The Jade Emperor's appearance is disrespectful to his supreme position.
