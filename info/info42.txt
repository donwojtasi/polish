Poe Divination （{font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}擲茭{/font}, Zhi Jiao）

Poe Divination (lit. "throwing poe") is a traditional Chinese divination method, in which the divination seeker takes two little wooden pieces (poes, or Jiao Bei in Mandarin, lit. "bamboo cups") and throws or drops them onto the floor. 

The positions of the pieces dictate a divine answer on whether the future course of actions that the seeker is contemplating is recommended or not.

The poes themselves are made out of wood or bamboo carved into a crescent shape. Each poe is round on one side (the Yin side) and flat on the other (the Yang side). 

There are four possible answers that the divination can produce:
— Holy Poe: One poe Yin and the other Yang indicates a "yes".

— Angry Poe: Both poes Yin indicates a "no". It is said the gods are displeased by the question.

— Laughing Poe: If both poes are Yang. It can have different interpretations since "laughing" means the gods are laughing at the question. Normally it means the answer to the question is too obvious, and the querent should not bother gods with such an easy question.

— If one or both poes are dropped but stand on their sides, it indicates that the gods do not understand the querent's question.
