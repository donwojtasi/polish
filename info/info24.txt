Old Street Snacks

The street village in Nekojishi is based on a real attraction in Taipei. Both millet mochi and iced hot spring eggs are specialties there.

Mochi, or rice cake, is a traditional food in Southern China, usually made from sticky rice. Millet is rarely planted in Southern China but is a staple food of the Amis tribe in Taiwan. Therefore, millet mochi can be considered as a dessert that represents the history of both Han and Amis people.

Iced hot spring eggs are made by chilling a boiled egg in ice water. Said eggs are boiled in hot spring water so they have a special aroma that's hard to duplicate.
