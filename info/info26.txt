Clairvoyant and Clairaudience

Clairvoyant and Clairaudience are two gods who work under Goddess Mazu. They were both yaoguai before enlisted by the goddess.

Clairvoyant can see things thousands of miles away, and Clairaudience can hear every voice carried by the wind. They are the left and right hand assistants to assist Goddess Mazu in observing the condition of her people.
