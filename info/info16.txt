Chi

Chi (lit. "breath", "air", or "gas") represents "material energy" in traditional Chinese culture.

Simply speaking, Chi is believed to be an active principle forming a part of every living thing. However, in some theories, Chi is actually the basic substance that forms everything, which implies a traditional opinion in Chinese culture that everything has life.

In this case, both "visible things" and "invisible things" are made of Chi. So are gods and spirits. Although, normally when people talk about Chi, they only refer to the invisible energies imperceptible to humans.

Therefore, when it is said that gods consume Chi from foods it refers to these imperceptible energies rather than any perceptible ones. This is why ordinary people don't notice any changes.
