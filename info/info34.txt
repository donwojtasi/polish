Princess Baleng

Princess Baleng is a famous heroine of Rukai legend. 

Her story has had many different incarnations as the Rukai legends are only passed down through oral history. This is because the Rukai language doesn't have any written form.

Baleng was the daughter of the leader of Dadele tribe. One day she was lost in the woods and met a young man and soon fell in love with him. When the couple returned to Dadele tribe along with the young man's clansmen, what Baleng's family saw was their daughter along with dozens of snakes. It turned out that the young man was the monarch of said snakes' kingdom.
