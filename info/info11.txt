Leopard Cat ({font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}石虎{/font}, Shihu)

The leopard cat ({i}Prionailurus bengalensis{/i}) is a small wild cat native to South and East Asia. 

A leopard cat is about the same size as a domestic cat, but slenderer, with longer legs and well-defined webs between its toes. Its small head is marked with two prominent dark stripes and a short and narrow white muzzle. 

People in Taiwan refer leopard cats as Shihu (lit. "Stone tiger"), which means "Tiger residing between the stones". (So it's a tiger somehow)

The leopard cat is currently listed as an endangered species in Taiwan, with an estimated population below 500.
