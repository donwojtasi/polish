Kochapongane

Kochapongane is a Rukai tribe located in Wutai, Pingtung. 

According to legends, a clouded leopard lead a tribe to a place called Kochapongane six hundred years ago. This was where the tribe settled, forming the Kochapongane tribe of today.

However, Kochapongane as seen on maps today is not the same place mentioned above as the entire tribe had to move due to poor environmental conditions between 1977 and 1979.
