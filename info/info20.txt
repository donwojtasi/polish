Kongadavange

Kongadavange is a Rukai tribe located in Maolin district, Kaohsiung.

A long time ago, there were four small tribes in the mountains of Kongadavange. One day a hunter went hunting in Kongadavange with his hound (Some say that the name of his hound was Clouded Leopard, but others say that the hound itself was a clouded leopard), but the hound didn't come back home with him. 

When the hunter went back to Kongadavange, he found the hound prone on the ground near a spring. The hunter saw this as a sign that this might be a place of great fortune. After learning of the hunter's story, all four tribes moved into that place, forming the bigger tribe of Kongadavange.
