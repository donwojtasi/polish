Grand Tree Lord （{font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}樹王公{/font}, Shuwanggong）

In some Chinese traditions, people tie a red strip of cloth to old trees as a rite that acknowledges that such tree has a soul, a tree god.

For some very old trees, people may even build temples for them enshrine them as gods. Those tree gods are called Grand Tree Lord.

Grand Tree Lords are considered local gods, similar to gods of soil. They are thought to protect their villages but are not considered high-level gods. Most Grand Tree Lords are either banyan trees or camphor trees.
