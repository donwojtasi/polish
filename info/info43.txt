Memorial Meeting in Chinese Tradition

In a memorial meeting, the relatives of the deceased light incense as a way of mourning. However, non-relatives such as colleagues and friends cannot light incense. They may only pick up the ashes of the incense and sprinkle them as a final salute to the deceased.

This tradition is considered to have originated from Buddhism and is commonly practiced in many Asian countries.
