Fudegong ({font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}福德公{/font})

Fudegong (lit. "Lord of Blessing and Virtue"), also known as Tudigong (lit. "Lord of the Soil and the Ground"), is a deity who cares after the locals in Chinese folk religion and Taoism. 

Some people consider his formal title as Fudezhengshen (lit. "Right God of Blessing and Virtue"), but commoners often call him "grandfather", which reflects his close relationship with the common people.
