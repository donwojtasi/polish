Rukai Spirit Mediums

Rukai people communicate with their gods through the help of spirit mediums, such as oracles (barakalai) and witch doctors (taraivigi).

There's only one oracle in each tribe to take care of major ceremonies. The oracle must be male and is selected by the nobility of the tribe. The residence of the oracle is called tabarakaladhane, and this place is also considered as the residence of the gods.

On the other hand, there can be many witch doctors within a tribe. Witch doctors must be female and are believed to heal people with the power of a god called Pelenge.
