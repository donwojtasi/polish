The Chief God

A temple usually doesn't enshrine only one god. According to the needs of their worshippers, large temples may contain statues of multiple gods for people to worship. Typically, there are four types of god in such temples:

The Chief God: The god primarily worshipped in the temple. People usually name the temple after the god's name/title. For example: Mazu Temple.

Secondary Gods: Secondary gods are god related to the chief god, including the chief god's spouse, subordinates, or guards.

Temple-Sharing Gods: They don't have specific relations with the chief god, but they are enshrined in the same temple for various reasons.

Visiting Gods: Gods enshrined in other temples with their statues temporarily placed in said temple.

For example, many gods of soil have guardian tiger statues as their guards. In such case, the god of soil is the Chief God and the guardian tigers are secondary gods in the temple.
