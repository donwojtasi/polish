Guanyin （{font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}觀音{/font}）

Guanyin, named from the Sanskrit Avalokitasvara, which means "sound perceiver", is an East Asian bodhisattva. 

Bodhisattva is a term used to describe those motivated by great compassion, therefore Guanyin is commonly known as the "Goddess of Mercy". Guanyin is one of the most famous gods known to Chinese people.

According to the needs and requests of the worshippers, a bodhisattva may appear as either male or a female. Therefore, we may also say that bodhisattva's don't have any genders.  The majority of Guanyin statues built in China before the Tang Dynasty were male, although most people now consider Guanyin as female. This is also why she is now known as the "Goddess of Mercy".
