Located on Dihua Street in Taipei, the Xia-Hai City God Temple is the most famous City God Temple in Taipei. 

In 19th century, immigrants from Quanzhou, Fujian brought the statue of the Xia-Hai City God to Taipei, who soon became the city god of Taipei.

Even though the Xia-Hai City God Temple is only around 200 square metres in space there are more than 600 statues enshrined there, making it the "most crowded" temple in Taiwan.
