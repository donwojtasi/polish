Millet Wine

Aboriginal Taiwanese people have unique wine culture of using millet to make wines.

Taking the Rukai people as an example, they call millet wine "bava", which means "water that makes people not shy". Also, Rukai people don't drink alone and will share the wine with everyone on the table.
