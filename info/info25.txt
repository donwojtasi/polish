Orthodox God

As Yin and Yang may refer to "under the surface" and "on the surface" correspondingly, Taoism temples fall into two categories: Yang Temples and Yin Temples.

A Yang Temple is a temple that enshrine a god (or multiple gods) with "genuine godship", which means the god has been authenticated by The Jade Emperor or a human emperor. A god with genuine godship is considered an orthodox god.

Similarly, a Yin Temple is a temple that enshrine a god (or multiple gods) without "genuine godship". Normally, a Yin Temple is built by the local people to serve local ghosts or yaoguai as gods to appease them and prevent them from harming people.
