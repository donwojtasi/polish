Roast Suckling Pig

Roast suckling pig is a traditional Chinese cuisine with a long history. Similar cuisines can also be found in other cultures around the world.

Traditionally speaking, roast suckling pig refers to a dish involving a whole pig, but smaller sizes are more popular these days. You can even find the dish sold in night markets.

In Chinese tradition, the pig is considered an important sacrifice. Nowadays Cantonese style suckling pig is well-known around the world, probably because of the popularity attained from the local population's great respect to the formal sacrifice traditions.

In a formal sacrifice rite, three kinds of sacrifice must be prepared: raw, half-cooked, and well-cooked. 

According to some traditions, raw sacrifices are for the guardian tigers, half-cooked sacrifices are for the primal gods, and well-cooked sacrifices are for the ancestors. For ordinary families, an easy way to prepare this is to provide three different dishes made from just one suckling pig.
