Yaoguai

Yaoguai (lit. the evil and strange), is a Chinese term that generally means "demon". 

Traditionally, Han people (China's largest ethnic group) believe that animals and lifeless things may obtain souls and human wisdoms if they become old enough. 

This kind of yaoguai is usually called "Jing" (lit. sprite), for example: Hulijing means "fox sprite" where "huli" means "fox". With the growth of their life, yaoguais may attain skills such as speaking human language, changing their appearance and possessing others.
