Emperor Wenchang （{font=tl/None/NotoSansCJKtc-Regular.otf}文昌帝君{/font}, Wenchang Di Jun）

Emperor Wenchang, also known as Wenchang Wang (lit. King Wenchang), is a Taoist deity worshipped as the god of culture and literature. 

He has historically been called upon by scholars and writers who need inspiration or students who need help right before an exam.

Traditionally speaking, Emperor Wenchang doesn't bless you for achieving literary success, but for attaining a high exam ranking. Therefore, you may still ask help from this god of literature for mastering a math exam.
